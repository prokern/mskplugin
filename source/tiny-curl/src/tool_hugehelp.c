"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       curl [options / URLs]\n"
"\n"
"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       curl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the\n"
"       supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,  IMAP,\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"       IMAPS,  LDAP,  LDAPS,  MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP,\n"
"       SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command  is  designed  to\n"
"       work without user interaction.\n"
"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-\n"
"       fer  resume,  Metalink,  and more. As you will see below, the number of\n"
"       features will make your head spin!\n"
"\n"

 fputs(
"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"

"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\n"
"       tion in RFC 3986.\n"
"\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\n"
"       within braces and quoting the URL as in:\n"
"\n"
"         \"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"

"\n"
"         \"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"\n"
"\n"
"       Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next\n"
"       to each other:\n"
"\n"
"         \"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"\n"
